# The jameskitt616 chronicles
Henry shuddered in fear, all he did was warn James of mod misconduct. Yet there James stood after emerging from his computer screen, James showed him unimaginable horrors and said one thing before running back through the computer, "I am the owner of Techlore, you are merely the face".

Henry gasped in terror; his worst nightmare of self-regulated communities had come true, by his own hand. The air grew dense and each text from james cumulatively filled him with dread as his eyes hung blank.

Platekoala posted a meme in general, fantasycookie gave him a warning and directed him to memes but James was not as forgiving. Platekoala went out to buy some milk but when he got to the store James blocked his entrance.
"Think before you post." 
"Huh?" 
James then snapped his fingers and sent Platekoala to his pocket dimension of miscellaneous horrors. James then took over Platekoalas matrix account so no one would wonder about a thing. 

James' rage began to overflow. A leaked conversation showed that Henry was planning to ban James from matrix and discord with one shot with plans to stop him from making his way back into the community
James plotted, but knew this was going to have to be malicious and show Henry who's the boss. James messaged Henry through one of his many puppet accounts with vague threats, James did this with hundreds of accounts, each account said the same message word for word. Henry was getting concerned and knew that  this was James' doing. It was time for the plan to be put in action.
