Henry shuddered in fear, all he did was warn James of mod misconduct. Yet there James stood after emerging from his computer screen, James showed him unimaginable horrors and said one thing before running back through the computer, "I am the owner of Techlore, you are merely the face".

Henry gasped in terror; his worst nightmare of self-regulated communities had come true, by his own hand. The air grew dense and each text from james cumulatively filled him with dread as his eyes hung blank.

Platekoala posted a meme in general, fantasycookie gave him a warning and directed him to memes but James was not as forgiving. Platekoala went out to buy some milk but when he got to the store James blocked his entrance.
"Think before you post." 
"Huh?" 
James then snapped his fingers and sent Platekoala to his pocket dimension of miscellaneous horrors. James then took over Platekoalas matrix account so no one would wonder about a thing.
